          Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m <span className="text-red-500 font-semibold">Snigdha Srivatsava</span> â€” 
          a curious engineer who believes clean architecture and clever automation 
          can solve almost anything (except maybe a flaky Wi-Fi connection).  
          I build software that connects systems, simplifies data, and scales ideas.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          With over three years of experience {" "}
          in <span className="text-red-500 font-medium">systems and software engineering, 
          </span>Iâ€™ve worked on everything from distributed data pipelines to real-time monitoring platforms.  
          My toolkit includes{" "}
          <span className="text-red-500 font-medium">
            Python, Go, Java, FastAPI, React, AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, and PostgreSQL
          </span>, and my codeâ€™s mission is always the same â€” make systems faster, cleaner, and just a little smarter.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          I completed my{" "}
          <span className="font-semibold">Masterâ€™s in Computer Science</span> at{" "}
          <span className="font-semibold">University of Massachusetts Amherst</span>, 
          where I explored distributed computing, machine learning, and intelligent systems.  
          Whether itâ€™s designing backend APIs, building scalable data infra, or 
          teaching models to think, I love bridging reliability with innovation.

          When Iâ€™m not debugging code, youâ€™ll probably find me debugging life â€”
